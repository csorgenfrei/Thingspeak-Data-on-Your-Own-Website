# Thingspeak-Data-on-Your-Own-Website
Display dynamic Thingspeak data on your own website with flask

While it is perfectly possible to use Thingspeak to display and analyze IoT Data, you may want to display the data on a customized website (or store it somewhere in a database, file, etc.). Thingspeak provides an API that I used together with a Python flask server and chart.js to display the data on a website (running on heroku.com for test purposes).

I used an ultrasonic ranger to measure distance (in cm) towards an object (for example, to measure the waterlevel in a cistern).
