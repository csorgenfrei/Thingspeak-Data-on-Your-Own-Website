# Thingspeak-Data-on-Your-Own-Website
Display dynamic Thingspeak data on your own website with flask

This example uses well documented code from the LMIC library to send data through a thethingsnetwork.org gateway. I struggled a bit to get this data on a website. In the end I used the thethingsnetwork integration to thingspeak, from where I could use an API. I include the Arduino code to transmit data to thethingsnetwork.org for completeness.
